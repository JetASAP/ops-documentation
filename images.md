Images
========================

Images (disk images) are the artifacts produced by OPS. These disk
images can be ran on a variety of hypervisors including the top public
cloud providers such as AWS and Google Cloud.

All local images are stored locally in `~/.ops/images/` and can be viewed
like:

```
$ ops image list -t onprem
```
